/**
 * Defines the structure and behavior for representing content types.
 *
 * A content type is typically used to describe the media type of data, consisting of a `type` and `subtype` component.
 * Implementations of this interface encapsulate these components and provide a derived `mimeType` property that
 * combines the type and subtype into a standard MIME type format.
 *
 * Example usages include specifying content types for HTTP requests and responses, file handling, and data serialization formats.
 *
 * @property type Represents the primary type of the content, such as `text`, `application`, or `image`.
 * @property subtype Represents the specific subtype of the content within its primary type, such as `plain` or `json`.
 * @property mimeType Concatenates the `type` and `subtype` properties into a single MIME type string, formatted as `type/subtype`.
 *                   This provides a standardized representation of the content type.
