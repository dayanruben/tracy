/**
 * Marks declarations that are **internal** to the Tracy library.
 *
 * This annotation indicates that the marked API should not be used outside
 * the Tracy library modules. APIs marked with this annotation:
 * - Are subject to change without notice
 * - May be removed in any release
 * - Provide no compatibility guarantees
 * - Are only public for technical reasons (cross-module visibility)
 *
 * **Usage of internal APIs is strongly discouraged** and should only be done
 * if you understand the risks. If you need functionality provided by an internal
 * API, please report your use case to the [Tracy issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/projects/TRA/issues)
 * so a stable public API can be provided.
 *
 * To use APIs marked with this annotation, you must explicitly opt-in by either:
 * - Adding `@OptIn(InternalTracyApi::class)` to your declaration
 * - Adding `-Xopt-in=ai.jetbrains.tracy.core.InternalTracyApi` to your module's compiler options
