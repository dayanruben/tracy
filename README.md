## 🛠️ General Information
The AI Development Kit is a toolkit
designed to streamline and speed up the development of AI-powered features at JetBrains. 
It tackles critical pain points across both research and product development workflows —
especially within the Kotlin and IntelliJ ecosystem.

## 💡 Motivation
* **Slow Prototyping**: Lack of internal APIs for experimentation delays research and prototyping.
* **Quality Gaps**: No consistent or systematic evaluation pipeline leads to risk of low-quality results.
* **Fragmented Tooling**: There’s no unified, Kotlin-native tooling for tracing, evaluation, and collaboration like what Python has.

## 🎯 Goals of the AI Development Kit
* **Unify Evaluation Practice**  
  Establish a consistent, test-driven, and criteria-based evaluation process across all development stages from early research to production deployment.
* **Bridge Python and JVM Tooling**  
  Integrate powerful Python-based evaluation tools into the Kotlin ecosystem.
* **Promote Collaboration**  
   Enables seamless collaboration between developers, QA engineers,
  and researchers through shared datasets, trace tracking,
  and unified tooling.
* **Support Agentic AI Development**  
   Provides robust infrastructure for agent-based workflows, including prompt engineering, traceable evaluations, and role-specific testing support.

## ⭐ Key features
* 🔍 Kotlin-native tracing via `@KotlinFlowTrace` and compiler plugin.
* 🔌 Integration with `Langfuse`, `Mlflow` and `Weights & Biases`.
* 📊 Evaluation framework with test cases and evaluation criteria.
* 🤖 Internal `OpenAI` compatible gateway with `LiteLLM` support. For a more detailed description, refer to the [article](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/articles/JBAI-A-659/LiteLLM-Internal-LLM-Gateway-for-Research-and-Experimentation)

## 📚 How to use Tracing?

You can find the latest versions of `ai-dev-kit` [here](https://jetbrains.team/p/ai-development-kit/packages/maven/ai-development-kit).

#### 1. Add Maven Repository
In your `build.gradle.kts`, add the following Maven repository:
```kotlin
maven {
    url = uri("https://packages.jetbrains.team/maven/p/ai-development-kit/ai-development-kit")
}
```

#### 2. Set Up `libs.versions.toml`
Configure your libs.versions.toml file with the appropriate versions:
```toml
[versions]
ai-dev-kit-plugin = "VERSION"
ai-dev-kit = "VERSION"

[libraries]
ai-dev-kit-tracing = { module = "com.jetbrains:ai-dev-kit-tracing", version.ref = "ai-dev-kit" }

# You can choose from multiple tracing providers:
# - Langfuse (used in the example below)
# - MLflow
# - Weights & Biases (W&B)
ai-dev-kit-tracking-langfuse = { module = "com.jetbrains:ai-dev-kit-tracking-langfuse", version.ref = "ai-dev-kit" }
# ai-dev-kit-tracking-mlflow = { module = "com.jetbrains:ai-dev-kit-tracking-mlflow", version.ref = "ai-dev-kit" }
# ai-dev-kit-tracking-wandb = { module = "com.jetbrains:ai-dev-kit-tracking-wandb", version.ref = "ai-dev-kit" }

[plugins]
ai-dev-kit = { id = "ai.dev.kit.trace", version.ref = "ai-dev-kit-plugin" }
```
Replace `VERSION` with the latest version from the JetBrains repository.

#### 3. Add Dependencies
In your module's `build.gradle.kts`, add the required dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.ai.dev.kit.tracing)
    implementation(libs.ai.dev.kit.tracking.langfuse)
}
```

#### 4. Enable Tracing with `@KotlinFlowTrace`

* Make sure to apply the `ai-dev-kit` plugin in your `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
plugins {
    alias(libs.plugins.ai.dev.kit)
}
```
* Set up tracing using a tracking provider.
  The example below uses Langfuse,
  but you can replace it with other supported platforms
  (e.g., Weights & Biases, MLflow) by making the corresponding changes in your setup:
```kotlin
setupLangfuseTracing()
// Your code with tracing
TracingFlowProcessor.flushTraces()
```
⚠️ Important:
1. You **must** set up tracing by calling `setupLangfuseTracing()` before using any annotated methods. If tracing is not initialized, the tracking provider will not be defined, and traces will not be recorded.
2. Ensure that you call `TracingFlowProcessor.flushTraces()` after all tracing operations to flush any pending traces. Without this, traces may not be exported if the application terminates too quickly.


* Annotate traced function with `@KotlinFlowTrace`

## 📚 How to use Evaluation?

Evaluation includes and relies on tracing.
In addition to adding the tracing dependency as explained above, add the evaluation dependency:

```toml
[libraries]
ai-dev-kit-eval = { module = "com.jetbrains:ai-dev-kit-eval", version.ref = "ai-dev-kit" }
```

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation(libs.ai.dev.kit.eval)
}
```

In code, you will need to define some unified classes for the AI feature you're evaluating:

1. `class InputOfYourFeature : AIInput`, `class OutputOfYourFeature : AIOutput`
2. `class YourGT : GroundTruth` to add all the information necessary to score the output. If no information is needed,
   you can use the `NoGroundTruth` stub.
3. `class YourGenerator : Generator<InputOfYourFeature, OutputOfYourFeature>` that encapsulates your feature.
4. `class YourEvaluator : Evaluator<OutputOfYourFeature, YourGT, MultiScoreEvalResult>` that assess the output
5. `class YourEval : LangfuseEvaluationTest<InputOfYourFeature, YourGT, OutputOfYourFeature, MultiScoreEvalResult>`
   that uses `YourGenerator` internally to execute your AI feature and `YourEvaluator` to score the output.
   The eval dataset is passed by overriding the `testCases` field.

Once you have that, you can run `YourEval` as a usual JUnit test and view the results on Langfuse.

For more details, refer to the two examples:

1. `HaikuGeneratorTest`: simple eval for LLM-written haikus that use LLM-as-a-Judge as a
   metric, [code in this repo](https://github.com/JetBrains/ai-dev-kit/blob/main/ai-dev-kit-example/src/test/kotlin/ai/dev/kit/example/haiku/HaikuGeneratorTest.kt)
2. `FindMiniAgentTest`: a simple eval for the file search
   agent [in the code engine repo](https://github.com/JetBrains/code-engine/pull/578/files#diff-701529c49dd319c5a627afaf6eb23ea130b44cfd6dce43d2051999a961afa6f6)

When a pull request is created, a comment is automatically added with instructions for running the publishing build.

### 🧪 Running Tests
The AI Development Kit uses test tags to manage which tests are executed in different environments.
Tests or test classes tagged with `SkipForNonLocal` are designed to run only in local environments.
When the `aiDevKitLocalTests` system property is set to `false` (the default is `true`), these tests are excluded from execution.
This ensures that tests tagged with `SkipForNonLocal` do not run on TeamCity or other non-local environments.
